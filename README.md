# Dataview Loader widget

This widget is no longer working. 

We attached a test project with 2 examples:

https://github.com/appronto/DataviewLoader/releases/download/4.0/DataViewLoaderAlternative.mpk

- Default out-of-the-box Mendix components 
    A listview + nanoflow + microflow
- Skeleton widget: https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/119807
- In View Content Renderer: https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/218777

Both solutions needs a boolean to determine if loading is completed.
